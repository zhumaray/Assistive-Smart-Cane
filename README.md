## Project Overview
The Assistive Smart Cane – Arduino Edition is a hardware control project designed to help visually impaired people avoid falling. The system detects stairs, holes, curbs, and sudden ground-level drops before physical contact and alerts the user using vibration feedback.

## Problem
Traditional white canes detect obstacles only after touch, which may be too late to prevent falls, especially on stairs going down or uneven surfaces.

## Solution
This project enhances a traditional cane by integrating:
- Arduino Nano
- HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor (mounted at the bottom of the cane)
- Vibration motor for tactile feedback

The sensor measures distance to the ground in real time. When a dangerous drop is detected, the vibration motor alerts the user before contact.

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Nano
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Vibration Motor Module
- Battery Power Supply
- Connecting Wires

## How It Works
1. Ultrasonic sensor measures distance to the ground.
2. Arduino Nano processes the distance data.
3. If unsafe distance is detected, vibration motor activates.
4. User receives early warning and reacts safely.

## Social Impact
- Prevents falls and injuries
- Supports elderly users and fast walking users
- Enhances — not replaces — the traditional white cane
